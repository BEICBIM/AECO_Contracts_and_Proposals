A library of open-source, relational contracts and proposals for facilities and infrastructure systems owners, designers, and constructors.  These documents, when referenced by, and executed within an *integrated organization* (a team that virtually operates as a corporation committed to the project), enable the *target value design* (a design for performance within the constraint of a budget), and establishes the paradigm for sharing information among all team members within the integrated organization.
